# url-shortner
A url-shortner made with node.js, express.js, mongoose and javascript. It has a little animation when submiting a url and the api comes along with Rate limitting and validation. To test this shortner you have to setup a local mongodb database or a mongodb atlas database. After that you have to include the URI String in the .env-sample file along with the Domain url you want it to run. If you have finshed renaming the .env-sample to .env you are good to go.
